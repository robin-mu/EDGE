# EDGE Font Converter
This tool converts the font.bin file to .svg files for each letter and a .ttf file that you can use as a font in other programs.

## Usage
You have to have Python and [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/) installed. Without FontForge, only .svg files are generated, no .ttf file. Remember the path to the folder into which you installed FontForge. <br/> Place font.bin (located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\EDGE`) into the same folder as the scripts and run `generate_font.bat`. Copy the path to your FontForgeBuilds folder into the console when prompted.
