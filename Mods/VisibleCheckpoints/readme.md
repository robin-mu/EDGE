# Visible Checkpoints
This mod makes questionmarks appear at all checkpoint areas in every level. The hologram cube shows the respawn point. This can be useful for finding skips in IL (or even RTA) speedrunning as entering a checkpoint area and then selecting "last checkpoint" in the pause menu can respawn you a few blocks nearer the goal.

## Installation
