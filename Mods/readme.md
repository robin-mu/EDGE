# Mods
## Visible Checkpoints
This mod makes questionmarks appear at all checkpoint areas in every level. The hologram cube shows the respawn point. This can be useful for finding skips in IL (or even RTA) speedrunning as entering a checkpoint area and then selecting "last checkpoint" in the pause menu can respawn you a few blocks closer to the goal.

Note: For some reason resizers are not properly visible and some buttons do not work correctly.

## Java and Mobile
These mods contain the levels from the Java version (found on Java Mobile Phones and PSP) and Mobile version (found on iOS and Android). The differences between these and the Steam version are documented on [this wiki page](https://github.com/robin-mu/EDGE/wiki/Platform-Differences).
